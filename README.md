## Description

My first project with React! I am very happy with this accomplishment. Since I began the journey of learning to code, I had heard a lot of talk surrounding React and it's difficulty to learn. I certainly had to use a lot of brain power to figure this one out. I spent the majority of my time comprehending state. Particularly the hook useState(). This was the foundation of my project. I used this hook to store all of the input fields' values in an object. I then used this object as an array, which allowed for me to cycle through all the data the user had input. Once I had all that data, I exported this information to ExpenseDisplay component. This componenet then rendered the information in the form of a table (styled with Bootstrap) and sent this information back to the InputFields component. The user can also delete any of the rows if they choose.
